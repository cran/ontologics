<div id="sources-ontologysources" class="section level2">
<h2>Sources (<a href="mailto:ontology@sources" class="email">ontology@sources</a>)</h2>
<p>Each row in the sources table represents a source of one or more
concepts and/or classes. A source is typically some form of a knowledge
organization system (KOS); e.g., a vocabulary. A source record features
the nine properties:</p>
<p><strong>id</strong> (<em>generated</em>): Unique identifier of this
source record. Built by counting upwards, starting with
<code>1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>label</strong> (<em>mandatory</em>): A speaking label for the
source.</p>
<p><strong>version</strong> (<em>optional</em>): The version of the
source.</p>
<p><strong>date</strong> (<em>optional</em>): The creation date of the
source.</p>
<p><strong>description</strong> (<em>optional</em>): A description of
the source.</p>
<p><strong>homepage</strong> (<em>optional</em>): Homepage of the
source.</p>
<p><strong>uri_prefix</strong> (<em>optional</em>): Prefix of the
resources of the ontology. See also [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/" class="uri">https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/</a>] at 2.4 IRIs. If no
<code>uri_prefix</code> for the harmonized resources of the ontology is
given, the <code>export_as_rdf()</code> function, inserts the
placeholder value
<code>http:[slash][slash] www[dot]example[dot]org[slash]ontologics</code>.
If non-harmonized sources are provided without a <code>uri_prefix</code>
they are ignored by the <code>export_as_rdf()</code> function.</p>
<p><strong>license</strong> (<em>mandatory</em>): Licensing information
of the source-KOS.</p>
<p><strong>notes</strong> (<em>optional</em>): Further notes about the
source.</p>
<p>The first row of the sources table refers the ontology itself as a
source. Every harmonized concept and class is considered to belong to
this source.</p>

<h2>External Classes (<a href="mailto:ontology@classes" class="email">ontology@classes</a>$external)</h2>
<p>A record in this table identifies an external class. External denotes
that the definition, label, etc. of this class was initially done
somewhere else, i.e. not in this ontology. An external class record
features five properties:</p>
<p><strong>id</strong> (<em>generated</em>): <strong>NOT IMPLEMENTED
YET</strong>. Unique identifier of this external class record. The ID is
generated automatically by the software. The generation logic
concatenates the source label of this concept with a counter. The
concatenation string is <code>:class_</code>
(<source_label>:class_<class_nb_for_this_source>, e.g.,
<em>wikidata:class_1</em>).</p>
<p><strong>label</strong> (<em>optional</em>): The label of the external
class as it is defined by the source.</p>
<p><strong>description</strong> (<em>optional</em>): The description of
the external class as it is defined by the source.</p>

<h2>Harmonised Classes (<a href="mailto:ontology@classes" class="email">ontology@classes</a>$harmonised)</h2>
<p>A harmonised class record describes a harmonised class. Harmonised
indicates that the label and definition of this class are used by this
ontology. A harmonised class record features eight properties:</p>
<p><strong>id</strong> (<em>generated</em>): <strong>NOT IMPLEMENTED
YET</strong>. Unique identifier of this harmonised class record. The ID
is generated automatically by the software.</p>
<p>The ID consists of multiple 3-digit codes that begin with prefixed a
dot, e.g. <code>.004.002.007</code>. The number of the codes indicates
the hierarchical level of the class - third level in the example - where
the first level is the broadest. The ID is read from right to left. The
example ID means that the according class is the 7th class that was
defined in the 3rd hierarchical level, it has a narrower meaning than
2nd the class that was defined in the 2nd hierarchical level, which in
turn has a narrower meaning than the 4th class that was defined in the
1st (the broadest) hierarchical level.</p>
<p><strong>label</strong> (<em>mandatory</em>): The label of the
harmonised class.</p>
<p><strong>description</strong> (<em>optional</em>): The description of

harmonised class to another harmonised class that conveys a broader
meaning. As an example, with this relation, a class <em>land-use</em>

broader meaning. Values are foreign keys to IDs in this table

<p><strong>has_exact_match</strong> (<em>optional</em>): Identifies any

(they can be used interchangeably in any context). Since, the ID
generation logic for external classes is not implemented yet, values are
strings of concatenated foreign keys to labels in the external classes
table (<code>ontology$classes$external$label</code>). Concatenation is
performed with <code>|</code>. Each foreign key is furthermore suffixed
with a dot and a number in the range from 1 to 3, e.g.,
<em>land-usage.3</em>. The number indicates the certainty of the match,
where 3 means <em>most certain</em>. An exact match entry for the
harmonised class <em>land-use</em> could therefore be <em>landuse.3 |
use-of-land.2 | land-usage.3</em>. (<strong>IN THE FUTURE</strong>:
values are strings of concatenated foreign keys to IDs in the external
